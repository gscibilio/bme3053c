# Background
*This program is designed to help clinicians identify, classify, and treat gliomas, or brain tumors, in a timely manner. We have created a code that will estimate the location and size of a tumor, as well as output an image with the tumor highlighted, and a treatment recommendation based on the size and location.*
*By creating a program to more easily classify tumors and provide information on them, treatment can begin much earlier, improving patient outcome.*

# Data Set
The data we used was provided by The Cancer Imaging Archive. The set contains 50 patients, but not all of them are compatible with this program. This is simply due to the nature of this project, and limited coding skills. However, the program works very well with roughly half of the patients included. All of the patient image files can be found in the main branch of the GitHub repository.

# Usage
In order to run our code, all the files and code must be in the same folder, so that Matlab can run through that folder and have access to both the code and all the images. The easiest way to do this is to either:

* Download the code file and all images, placing them in one folder, then route Matlab through this folder and run the code
* Run the code through the GitHub desktop. Anyone viewing this has been added as a collaborator, so the code and files can be pulled on the desktop app, making   them available on your computer. Matlab can then be routed through this folder, and the code should run smoothly.

# Output Information
The final output of this program is displayed in a figure window. If desired, this output can be screenshotted or downloaded. This is up to the user discretion, so a download function was not included in the code, leaving the option up to the user.

# Documents
Included below are two relevant documents, the Final Report for this project, and the presentation slides on the project. Feel free to take a look!
